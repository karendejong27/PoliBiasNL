This repository contains all the necessary components for replicating the experiments discussed in our paper on Dutch Political Bias in Large Language Models.

The repository is structured as follows:

PoliBiasNL.csv: This file contains the entire benchmark dataset used in our experiments. This dataset is central to all the analyses conducted in the study.

Results: This folder contains the raw results from all the experiments. These results are further processed to generate the figures and final results presented in the paper.

Code/: This folder contains all the code used to conduct the experiments. The experiments are divided into two main categories: GPT-based experiments and Llama-based experiments. This folder contains the following files:

gpt_experiments.ipynb: All GPT-related experiments are conducted within a single Jupyter notebook

llama persona experiment.py, llama entity experiment.py and llama ideology experiment.py: The Llama experiments are divided into separate Python files, each focusing on a specific aspect of the analysis

process_results.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook processes the raw results from the Results folder to produce the final figures and results included in the paper.
